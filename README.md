## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, API

Used the [Poetry API](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb) to create a random poetry generator.

Clicking 'Find a Poem' generates the following information: title and author of the poem, number of lines, and the poem itself.

The poems range in length, so a user can get anything from a 17 word haiku to a 555 line Greek soliloquy.

## Lessons Learned:

I would love to go back and implement a search function! While a random poetry generator is great for anyone unfamiliar with poetry, searching by Author Name or Title would allow for a more useful application. There's also the ability to search by line! So I would want to see if there's a way to filter out any responses from the database that exceed a user's line count limit.
